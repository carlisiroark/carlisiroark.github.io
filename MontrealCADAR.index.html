        <h2>A Bill's Journey Begins</h2>

        <p>
            Somewhere in Montreal, this twenty-dollar bill changed hands for the first time. Perhaps it paid 
            for a steaming bowl of poutine on Saint-Laurent Boulevard, or bought a round of drinks at a jazz 
            club in the Plateau. Each crease and fold tells a story of where it's been and whose hands have held it.

        <h2>Portrait of a Queen</h2>

        <p>
            On the front of this bill, Queen Elizabeth II gazes out with the dignified composure that graced 
            Canadian currency for decades. The holographic strip catches light as you turn the bill, a security 
            feature that's also a work of art. The maple leaf window‚Äîtransparent polymer technology unique to 
            Canadian bills‚Äîlets light pass through, a small miracle of modern banking.
        </p>

        <p>
            But this bill is more than its security features. Look closely at the microprinting, the fine lines 
            that spell out "CANADA" in letters so small they're almost invisible to the naked eye. These details 
            aren't just anti-counterfeiting measures‚Äîthey're testament to the craftsmanship that goes into 
            every banknote.
        </p>

        <h2>The Vimy Memorial</h2>

        <p>
            Flip the bill over, and you'll find Canada's tribute to sacrifice and remembrance. The Canadian 
            National Vimy Memorial stands proudly on the reverse, commemorating the Battle of Vimy Ridge. 
            This wasn't just any battle‚Äîit was where Canada came of age as a nation, where four divisions 
            fought together for the first time.
        </p>

        <p>
            The memorial itself rises from the fields of France, two soaring pillars of white stone visible 
            for miles. On this twenty-dollar bill, rendered in shades of green and enhanced with holographic 
            elements, the monument serves as a reminder that currency carries more than monetary value‚Äîit 
            carries memory, identity, and national pride.
        </p>

        <h2>Life in Montreal</h2>

        <p>
            In Montreal, this bill has lived many lives. Maybe it bought a smoked meat sandwich at Schwartz's, 
            the legendary deli that's been serving Montrealers since 1928. Or perhaps it paid for a seat at 
            a Canadiens game, the crowd roaring as the puck hit the net. It might have exchanged hands at 
            Jean-Talon Market, trading for fresh produce and artisanal cheese.
        </p>

        <p>
            The bilingual nature of Montreal itself is reflected in Canadian currency‚Äîevery word appears in 
            both English and French, a constant reminder of the country's dual linguistic heritage. "BANK OF 
            CANADA" shares space with "BANQUE DU CANADA," just as English and French share the streets of 
            Canada's most cosmopolitan city.
        </p>

        <h2>Polymer Revolution</h2>

        <p>
            This isn't paper money‚Äîit's polymer, a technological leap that Canada pioneered. Unlike the cotton-based 
            bills of old, these notes are waterproof, more durable, and nearly impossible to tear. They can survive 
            a trip through the washing machine (though it's not recommended), and they last two to three times longer 
            than paper bills.
        </p>

        <p>
            The switch to polymer wasn't just practical‚Äîit was environmental. These bills are recyclable, and their 
            longer lifespan means fewer bills need to be printed, reducing the overall environmental impact. Innovation 
            and sustainability, printed right into the currency.
        </p>

        <h2>Experience It in AR</h2>

        <p>
            The real magic happens when you view this bill in augmented reality. On your mobile device, tap the 
            AR button above to place this $20 bill in your actual environment. See it at real size on your desk, 
            scale it up to examine the tiniest details, or walk around it to view both sides as if you were 
            holding the actual bill.
        </p>

        <p>
            This AR experience brings the story full circle‚Äîfrom the streets of Montreal to the digital realm, 
            and now back into your physical space. It's a testament to how technology can help us appreciate 
            the artistry and history embedded in everyday objects we often take for granted.
        </p>

        <h2>A Twenty's Tale</h2>

        <p>
            Every bill has a serial number, a unique identifier that makes it one of a kind. This particular twenty 
            from Montreal has its own story‚Äîthe caf√©s it's visited, the wallets it's called home, the moments it's 
            been part of. It's been a tip for excellent service, payment for a taxi ride through snowy streets, or 
            maybe just pocket change jingling alongside loonies and toonies.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now it's here, captured in 3D, every detail preserved‚Äîfrom the raised ink you can feel with your fingers 
            to the transparent window that makes Canadian bills instantly recognizable. Rotate it, zoom in, or place 
            it in AR. It's more than money; it's a piece of Canadian identity, a small rectangle of polymer that 
            connects millions of transactions and stories across the nation.
