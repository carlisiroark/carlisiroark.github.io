        <p class="lead text-center">Exploring which companies and parts are driving the rise in vehicle recalls over time.</p>
    
        <p>Product recalls are often seen as isolated incidents. A faulty batch here, a safety issue there. But if we take a step back and look at the data, a different picture emerges: product recalls have been rising over the past decade. At this same time, it's evident that a small group of companies are responsible for a significant share of these incidents. Perhaps it's not just a one-off thing? Or rather, perhaps this raises questions about corporate quality control and industry oversight.</p>

        <h4>Recalls on the Rise</h4>
        <p>According to the U.S. Department of Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, product recall data shows a steady increase in recalls over the past ten years. Said steadiness of this data suggests that external factors, from new safety regulations to shifts in manufacturing practices, could be playing a role. Multiple causes could be pointed to, such as increasing product complexity, the rise of global supply chains, and stricter reporting requirements.</p>

        <p>Looking at the cumulative total of recalls over time, the picture becomes even clearer. What once seemed like occasional blips have added up to thousands of unsafe parts and whole vehicles being pulled from the market...</p>

        <h4>Some Are Getting Worse, Others Better</h4>
        <p>Not all companies are following the same trajectory. Some firms have steadily reduced their number of recalls through better testing and design processes. Others have seen their recall numbers spike in recent years and exponentially over time — a worrying sign that improvements have not kept pace with growing complexity...</p>
